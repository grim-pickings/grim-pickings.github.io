                'I am a game designer/developer who specializes in gameplay programming mainly. My role on this project was to help with the tech portion of everything, where I worked with Tyvian Streets, Jake Oaks, and Michael Marckwordt. The different parts of the virtual game I worked on were the hand tracking component using Ultra-leap that controlled player movement and player versus player combat, the game controller game object that controls how long the different phases of the game should be depending on if itâ€™s the exploration phase or the combat phase, and an early version of the website/game app that was a progressive web application (this part of the project was scrapped, however).',

                'As a member of the artist team, I was tasked to create the design for the Grim Pickings website and to sculpt digital models which were printed as physical figurines for the board game.',
                'I worked with Ty Streets who utilized my designs and 3D animated assets to build the website. My idea was to employ an experiential design and to provide the user a unique sense of interaction with the displayed content. It was a pleasure to collaborate with the tech team to realize my visions and to create a setting that encourages people to fully engage with the website and become interested in Grim Pickings.',
                'Teaosha Cunningham created a 2D illustration of the main zombie character around which I sculpted a 3D model. I rigged the zombie model and gave it two different poses. Both poses were 3D printed separately to be used and manipulated physically during play of Grim Pickings. Overcoming the challenge of bringing a two-dimensional design into three dimensions brought me great satisfaction--and even more so when my digital models were eventually 3D printed as tangible pieces for the game.',
                'Grim Pickings is a project that provided me the opportunity to work with students of varying disciplines, and has stoked my passions to continue collaborating on projects that broaden my skillsets in the industry of game production.',
